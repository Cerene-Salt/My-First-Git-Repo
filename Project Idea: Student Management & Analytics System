Project Idea:
Right — that “Final Project” module is actually one of the most important parts of the syllabus, because it’s where all the individual skills you’ve learned stop being isolated exercises and start working together in a single, cohesive build.  

If Gemini skipped it, we can absolutely design it now so you still get the full benefit — and I’ll make sure it’s tailored to your **current Python background** and the fact that you’ve already done Git, OOP, algorithms, file I/O, and data structures.  

---

## 🎯 Goal of the Final Project
- Integrate **all** the topics you’ve covered:  
  Variables, loops, conditionals, data structures, error handling, file I/O, OOP (including encapsulation & polymorphism), algorithms, and Git.
- Simulate a **real-world workflow**: plan → build → test → version control → document.
- Produce something you can **showcase** in your portfolio before university.

## 💡 Project Idea: **Student Management & Analytics System**
A command-line Python application that:
1. **Stores student records** (name, ID, courses, grades) using **lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets**.
2. **Allows CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) via a menu system.
3. **Implements OOP**:
   - `Student` class with encapsulated attributes.
   - `Course` class with polymorphic behavior for different course types (e.g., `LabCourse` vs `TheoryCourse`).
4. **Uses algorithms**:
   - Search for a student by ID (linear or binary search).
   - Sort students by GPA or name.
5. **Handles errors** gracefully with `try...except`.
6. **Persists data** to a file (CSV or JSON) and loads it on startup.
7. **Version control**:
   - Track progress with Git commits.
   - Push to GitHub after each major feature.
8. **Optional stretch**: Generate a simple report (average grades, top performers) and save it to a text file.

## 📅 Suggested Timeline (1 Week)
**Day 1–2:**  
- Plan features and data structures.  
- Set up Git repo and initial file structure.  

**Day 3–4:**  
- Implement core classes and CRUD operations.  
- Add file I/O for saving/loading data.  

**Day 5:**  
- Add search/sort algorithms.  
- Implement error handling.  

**Day 6:**  
- Test all features, fix bugs.  
- Commit and push final version to GitHub.  

**Day 7:**  
- Write a README with instructions, features, and what you learned.  

---

## 📌 Deliverables
- **Code** in a public GitHub repo.
- **README.md** explaining:
  - What the project does.
  - How to run it.
  - Which Python concepts it uses.
- **Commit history** showing incremental progress.

If you want, I can **draft the full project skeleton** for you — with the folder structure, starter code, and Git commit plan — so you can just fill in the logic step-by-step and know you’re hitting every syllabus requirement.  

Do you want me to prepare that skeleton for you so you can start building immediately?
