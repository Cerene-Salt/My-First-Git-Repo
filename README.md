# My First Git Repository
This repository is for practicing the fundamental concepts of Git and GitHub. It is part of my preparatory course for university.

The repository will contain simple Python files and exercises, including:
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Algorithms (Searching & Sorting)
- Data Structures (Lists & Linked Lists)

This project will help me get comfortable with version control, collaboration, and managing my code history.
