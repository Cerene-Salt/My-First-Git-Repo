Kiki, the workflow map I gave you is already a **solid backbone** â€” it tells you *what to do*, *when to do it*, and *when to get help*.  
But if you want a **full, endâ€‘toâ€‘end guidance pack** so tomorrow you can just open your laptop and follow a script without thinking about sequencing, I can expand it into a **Dayâ€‘byâ€‘Day Build Plan** with:

- **Exact daily goals** (so you donâ€™t overâ€‘ or underâ€‘work)  
- **Checkpoints** to make sure youâ€™re on track  
- **When to commit to Git** and what the commit message should be  
- **When to test** and what to test for  
- **When to ask AI/docs for help** vs. when to push through solo  

That way, youâ€™re not just holding a map â€” youâ€™ve got a **GPS with turnâ€‘byâ€‘turn directions**.

**Help sources:**  
- AI for examples of method overriding and encapsulation.  
- Docs for Python OOP.

---

### **Day 3 â€“ CRUD Operations**
**Goals:**
- Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete functions.
- Store data in lists/dictionaries.
- Connect CRUD to classes.

**Git commits:**
- `"Implement CRUD operations for student records"`

**Help sources:**  
- AI for debugging logic errors.  
- Docs for list/dict methods.

---

### **Day 4 â€“ File I/O Integration**
**Goals:**
- Add save/load functions for CSV or JSON.
- Ensure data persists between runs.
- Handle missing file errors.

**Git commits:**
- `"Add file save/load functionality with error handling"`

**Help sources:**  
- AI for troubleshooting file errors.  
- Docs for `open()`, `with`, `csv`/`json`.

---

### **Day 5 â€“ Algorithms**
**Goals:**
- Implement search (linear or binary).
- Implement sort (by name or GPA).
- Integrate into menu system.

**Git commits:**
- `"Add search and sort features"`

**Help sources:**  
- AI for efficiency tips.  
- Docs for `sorted()` and custom key functions.

---

### **Day 6 â€“ Testing & Edge Cases**
**Goals:**
- Test all features with valid and invalid inputs.
- Handle empty datasets, bad input, and file corruption.
- Polish menu and user prompts.

**Git commits:**
- `"Improve error handling and user experience"`

**Help sources:**  
- AI for best practices in exception handling.

---

### **Day 7 â€“ Final Polish & Push**
**Goals:**
- Review code for clarity and style.
- Update README with usage instructions.
- Push final version to GitHub.

**Git commits:**
- `"Finalize project and update documentation"`

**Help sources:**  
- AI for code review suggestions.  
- Docs for README formatting.

ðŸ’¡ **Rule of thumb:**  
If youâ€™re stuck for more than **15 minutes** on a bug or design decision â†’ check docs.  
If youâ€™re still stuck after **30 minutes** â†’ ask AI for help.  
If AIâ€™s answer still feels unclear â†’ simplify the feature and move on.

If you want, I can also prepare a **starter folder structure and empty Python files** with docstrings already in place for each part of the project â€” so tomorrow youâ€™re literally just filling in the blanks instead of setting up from scratch. That would make this *plugâ€‘andâ€‘play*.  

Do you want me to prep that starter structure for you?
